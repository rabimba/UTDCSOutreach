        Welcome to the UTD JavaScript Playground. Don't worry of you don't understand everything. We'll cover it in bits and pieces.

<div class="portlet-blue">
    <div class="title">
        <span>What to Expect in Warm-up Demo</span>
    </div>
    <a href="#clickcounter" class="text-solid">Click Counter</a>
    <div class="content">
        provides an extremly simple adaptation of click counter (knockout).
        In addition, I've added a lottery component to demonstrate inter-component interactions via events.

    <a href="#departments" class="text-solid"> MVVM</a>
    <div class="content">
        shows a bit more complex usage of javascrip MVVM
        architecture and its data bindings. The data for this panel is loaded from the server
        through AJAX calls. This component is an adaptation of KnockoutJS

    <div class="title">
        <span>Deep Diving</span>
    </div>
    <a href="#sales" class="text-solid">Complex Dashboard</a>
    <div class="content">
        Demonstrates the use of a shared view model across components. There are two views in
        this dashboard that use the same shared view model, which enables them to easily respond
        to each other without using events. In addition I use some UI widgets for graphs and trees
        in this sample.

    <a href="#employee/all" class="text-solid">List-Detail panels</a>
    <div class="content">
        A demonstration of implementing a list view and the relevant detail view
        that use URL navigation to switch back and forth. All information is loaded from the server on-demand as JSON
        documents.
    </div>
    <br/>
    <a href="#todo" class="text-solid">Your First exciting App - Todo</a>
    <div class="content">
       This is an To-Do implementation  using pure javascript. I've used backbone to make my life easier.
